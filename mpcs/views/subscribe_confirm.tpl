  <p>Thank you for subscribing! You are now a Premium user and have full access to your data that was previously locked up within the GAS (unfairly, we know). Please <a href="/annotations">click here</a> to view your annotation results.</p>

	<p>Your subscriber account number is <strong>{{stripe_id}}</strong>. Please make a note of this since the GAS service doesn't. Yes, we know we should, but at this stage we have your money and credit card details so we don't care much!</p>
